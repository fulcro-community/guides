# Guide to learning Fulcro

NOTE: Under development

There is plenty of materials - the excellent, comprehensive https://book.fulcrologic.com/[Fulcro Developers Guide], many hours of the invaluable https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVi9lDx-4C_T7jkihlQflyqGqU4xVtsfi[Fulcro 3 tutorial videos], https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom[Pathom] documentation, and various https://github.com/fulcro-community/awesome-fulcro#learning[learning resources from awesome-fulcro]. Then there is RAD and its documentation. It is overwhelming. Everybody will wonder:

> *Where to start? How to go about learning Fulcro?*

We hope this guide will be of help.

## Essential guidelines for learners

Different people learn best in different ways so there is no single, best way to learn Fulcro. Somebody likes to study a lot first, somebody prefers to jump into doing as soon as possible. We will try to cater to them all. However, no matter what kind of person you are, here is one important recommendation that applies to you all:

IMPORTANT: Fulcro is likely very different from anything you have used before. You need to really *understand the key concepts first*, before trying to create something. Otherwise you set yourself up for many struggles.

## Where to start?

### Recommended approach

WARNING: Very much a work in progress

1. Have a brief look at https://github.com/fulcro-community/awesome-fulcro[awesome-fulcro] so that you get an overview of what is available and can back to particular resources when you will need them
2. Read the beginning of https://book.fulcrologic.com/[Fulcro Developers Guide], at least up to and including "4. Getting Started"
   * Notice that the Book is essentially reference material and covers many areas and depth that you donâ€™t need to get a general understanding of Fulcro
3. If you are a visual person, have a look at the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVi9lDx-4C_T7jkihlQflyqGqU4xVtsfi[Fulcro 3 tutorial videos] - especially Parts 1 to 7 cover many of the pitfalls of getting started (Alex Eeberts' https://github.com/aeberts/fulcro-notes-public[Fulcro Video Notes (i.e. table of content)] might be helpful)
4. Clone and play with https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template/[fulcro-template]
5. Revisit https://github.com/fulcro-community/awesome-fulcro[awesome-fulcro] and the tutorials and troubleshooting materials it links to to check whether some of it isn't what you need just now

> *FAQ: What about Fulcro Rapid Application Development (RAD)?*
>
> While RAD is just an add-on to Fulcro and its demo project is perhaps more up to date, it brings its own additional concepts (attributes) and constructs (reports and forms) so it might be best to wait with it until you grasp Fulcro itself. On the other hand, folks have done that before...
